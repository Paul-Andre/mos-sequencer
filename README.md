# mos-sequencer

A music sequencer that was designed such that it would be possible to use it with alternative scale system. It should work particularly well with [MOS scales](http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/MOSScales).

The lines on the user interface represent the notes within the chosen scale. Notes can also be dragged higher or lower than the lines to represent "sharps" and "flats".

At the time being, the somewhat bizarre scale of A-Lydian mode is hard-coded. The scales don't need to be based on 12-tet though, and can be changed by changing the notes vector defined in main.
